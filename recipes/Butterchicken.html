    <h1>Butter chicken</h1>
    <p>
      This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite
      Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the
      chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the
      cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread./p>
